* **First steps:**
  * Clone this repository and create a new branch with convenient names like the followings:
    * add-problem-name
    * add-problem-name-approach-2
    * fix-problem-name-python-sol
    * fix-problem-name-readme
  * When you are done with your code open a new PR to the master and describe in your PR why you creating this PR:
    * Adding Problem Name (as a link to the problem) solution in [Chosen language].

******************

* **Add a new solution for an existing problem:**
  * You need to update the existing problem `README.md` file with your solution.
  * The file will be organized in this hierarchy:
    * Approach 1
    * Approach 2
    * ...etc
  * So check what is the level of your solution and add it:
    * Approach 2:<br>
        `your solution`

  * If you add a new solution without explaining it do your best at least to add the time & space complexity for it or pseudocode.
  * If you can not fit the previous step you can ignore the hierarchy of the `Approaches` and add your solution this way:
    * Another implementation in `the language you writing in`. (Make sure it is a URL to the solution.[js,java] file)

  * Let's say if your new solution is in a language already exist in the repo like `Solution.py` you can edit this file by adding
  another function lets say the solution in function called `sum2numbers(x,y)` add new function `sum2numbers_2(X,Y)`, I would
  prefer doing it this way otherwise you can create a new file called `Solution2.py`.

  * If your solution the same idea as `Approach 1` for example but in different language you just need to add as mentioned above and update the problem `README` file with a link to your code:
    * **Solution in java** as url of course to **Solution.java**.

**************

* **Add a new solution for a new problem:**
  * So, let's say the problem belongs to the `30-Day LeetCoding Challenge` so go to it is a directory and create a new folder
  with the problem name `new-problem` add a URL to that directory in the `README.md` if it is `week` not there add it as well in the same way as the existing ones.

  * Then, under the `new-problem` directory create `README.md` file and `Solution.[chosen-lang]`.
  * Write the `README.md` file in the same way as existing one's header with the problem name as URL to the problem
  location on Leetcode, then add `Approach 1` title then add your solution follow the steps as in the above section
  (Add a new solution for an existing problem).

  * What if it is a random problem from [Leetcode problem](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/), create a new directory
  for this new problem in the main folder `leetcode-problems/the-new-random-problem` and add it in the main [`README.md`](https://github.com/AhmedRaafat14/Leetcode-problems/blob/master/README.md) as well
  as URL to this new directory for sure, the structure of the `the-new-random-problem` must be the same as above.
